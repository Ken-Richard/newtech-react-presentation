# Central PA New Tech Meetup - React.js

## Example #1
Hello World in React: The HelloWorld component is implemented as a simple function.

## Example #2
The HelloWorld component is implemented with React.createClass. The component has state and a button that updates the state. The React system will automatically re-render when the state is updated.

## Example #3
The example was divided into smart and dumb components. The HelloWorld component has no state, renders the props passed to it, and fires the action function that is passed to it. The App component controls the state and updates the state based on actions.
